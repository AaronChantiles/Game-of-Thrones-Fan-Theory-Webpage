            <p><b>R + L = J</b></p>
            <p>The mother, somewhat literally, of all A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones theories. “R + L = J” stands for “Rhaegar plus Lyanna equals Jon” — the idea being that Jon Snow is not the bastard son of Eddard Stark, but rather the secret offspring of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned’s late sister Lyanna. Under this theory, Ned lied to everyone about the boy’s parentage — his wife Catelyn, his best friend Robert Baratheon, and Jon himself — as part of a deathbed promise to his sister, who died shortly after giving birth, to keep the last Targaryen safe. There’s additional speculation that Rhaegar and Lyanna were secretly wed in a polygamous marriage, making Jon a legitimate claimant to the Iron Throne.</p>

            <p>If true — and it’s so widely accepted among the fandom that it’s treated as canon — R + L = J changes everything. It means that Ned’s great shame wasn’t cheating on his wife, but lying to her and everyone else he cared about. It means that Jon is a metaphorical embodiment of both ice (Stark) and fire (Targaryen), and that he’s a child of destiny whom the prophecy-obsessed Rhaegar risked war and the destruction of his entire house to help create. And as the most famous and popular theory, it’s often the gateway drug for new readers into the theory-mongering mind-set that looks for secrets, clues, lies, and double meanings in every line.</p>
